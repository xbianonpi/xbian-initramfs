    Welcome to recovery boot console,

the root partition as specified in cmdline.txt or boot.src.txt is now mounted under
$CONFIG_newroot, boot partition is mounted under /boot and bond to /rootfs/boot as well.
The same applies for /proc, /sys, /dev and /run. You can chroot into your
installation with 'chroot $CONFIG_newroot'.
This will allow you work with you're XBian installation almost like in full booted
mode (restricted to text console) with effective uid=0 (root).

Network can be configured and started with 'ipconfig eth0' for dhcp mode, or
'ipconfig your-ip:[server-ip]:[gw-ip]:[netmask]:[hostname]:[eth0]' for static mode,
where
  your-ip .... is your ip address         [server-ip] . ip address of your server
  [gw-ip] .... ip address of your gateway [netmask] ... is your network mask
  [hostname] . is your local hostname     [eth0] ...... is your network device

After you finish your work, exit from chroot with 'exit' and then exit again from
recovery console shell. Your boot will continue.

In this environment, three aliases are already predefined. Just run:

'reb' to run 'umount -a; sync; reboot -fn'
        (unmounts all filesystems, sync writes and reboot)
'rum' to run 'umount -a'
'rch' to run 'chroot $CONFIG_newroot'
